•	Introduction

Entropy of a signal is a technique used to quantify the amount of regularity and the unpredictability of fluctuations over time-series data. It is used to numerically quantify the amount of irregularity or fluctuations in a given signal. Numerous methods exist to calculate the entropy of a given time-series. Some of these have been already applied to EEG data in the past. The entropies used in this project are Shannon, Tsallis, Renyi and Permutation entropy.

•	Time Dependent Entropy

Time Dependent Entropy corresponds to the trend of entropy of a given signal over time. To get a signal’s Time Dependent Entropy, the signal is first split into windows. This done using to parameters namely the window size (w) and step size (delta). The first window is from first to wth value of the discrete-time signal while the second window starts from (1+delta) to (1+w+delta) values of the signal and so on. Thus number of windows(M) created are, considering length of signal as K:

M= K-w/delta

The time dependent entropy is then calculated using each of these windows and thus M such values are obtained. These M values form a time-series called as the time-dependent entropy of the given time-series.

To find the entropy of a given window, various methods can be used. We employ some of these methods. First the minimum and maximum values of the signal in that window is noted. The amplitude interval between these two values is then divided into L intervals where L is a variable parameter. Then each of these slots/intervals are assigned a probability value. The probability value corresponds to the probability of the signal being in that interval which is equal to number of points in that interval divided by the total number of points in the interval. These probabilities are then used to calculate different entropies. We have used four such entropies:
1.	Shannon Entropy
2.	Tsallis Entropy
3.	Renyi Entropy
4.	Permutation Entropy

•	Theory

1.	Shannon Entropy
In development of foundations of classical information theory, a rigorous proof of Shannon’s entropy based on additivity law was presented. Suppose a system is divided into two subsystems A and B, and pij (A, B) is joint probability of finding A in ith state and B in jth state then:
pij (A, B) = pi(A) * pij(B|A)
Shannon’s entropy of this system is defined as 
S (A, B) = -kb∑ pij (A, B) * ln (pij (A, B))
Similarly, for a discrete time signal, the probabilities can be calculated as mentioned above. Let these values be pi where i belongs to (1, L). The Shannon entropy of this window will be:
Sh_ent = -∑pi * ln(pi)
2.	Tsallis Entropy and Renyi Entropy
Tsallis Entropy and Renyi entropy are modification of the well-known Shannon entropy. Both of them are non-additive and have been used to deal with EEG or EEG type discrete type signals before. They too rely on the same probability measures as Shannon entropy but have an additional parameter each, which can be used to bring out signal characteristics that Shannon entropy cannot highlight. Tsallis entropy can be modified by using its q value whereas Renyi entropy has a parameter known as alpha. Their formulas are:
Te_ent = -∑(piq-pi)
RE_ent = -∑piα/(1-α)
Thus both entropies can be modified by changing their parameters. Tsallis entropy can be used to estimate Shannon entropy as they tend to it at q tends to zero.

3.	Permutation Entropy
Permutation Entropy is a measure for arbitrary time series based on analysis of permutation patterns. It is different from the above entropies as it depends only on the shape of the time series rather than the actual value or amplitude of each point in the series. It is characterized by two parameters namely d and delay. D decides the number of points considered for the permutation. d points lead to different number of permutations. Delay is defined as the delay between two consecutive series considered. For example, a delay of 1 will not skip any points, delay of two will skip one point and so on. Then each permutation is given a respective probability and this is then used to calculate the permutation entropy of the given time series.
If the probability values are pk then permutation entropy is:
Per_ent = -∑pk * ln(pk)

•	Methods and Materials

The data used for the project consisted of two datasets. The first dataset consisted of mental fatigue data. The second dataset consisted of mental workload data. Similar techniques were applied to both datasets to see and analyse the trends in the TDE of the given time series.
For mental workload data, data collection was done from 30 subjects with two trials each. Each of these 60 datasets, after pre-processing, consisted of 24 channels and multiple 2s epochs with each epoch containing 500 data points. Thus we had 60 matrices of size 500xEx24. Each such matrix X had varying number of epochs represented by E. These 24 channels were then separated and the remaining matrix was then opened into a time series of length 500*E. Thus, 24 time-series were obtained for each subject per trial. Similarly, for the workload data consisted of 7 subjects with 512 data points per 2s epochs and 540 such epochs for each of the 62 channels. With the same approach as above, 62-time series were obtained per subject. From now on each of these channels or time-series will be denoted by Ch. Each such Ch was then stored in a separate text file so that it can be easily read by multiple python programs whenever required.
After each such Ch was written into a text file, it was read by a python program and entropies were generated. Different parameters were used for the two different tasks and those were selected which gave highest accuracy or the best trend. Each task is described in detail subsequently: 


1.)	Classification Task:

The classification task consisted of classifying the subject as fatigued or not fatigued. This was done using a support vector machine. The input had 24 features namely the entropies of the 24 channels. 300 points were selected from the initial and final parts of the EEG data respectively. It was assumed that he is not fatigued at the start and fatigued at the end. This was then fed to a svm classifier that did a 5-fold validation and returned average accuracy of the svm over these 5 validations. This was done for each trial and thus average accuracy was obtained. To improve accuracy, the same algorithm was applied over a range of C and gamma values for the svm kernel and hence maximum accuracy was obtained.
For the workload class a svm was used for multi-class classification. For this the decision function shape used was ‘ovo’. Datasets were collected in a similar pattern as earlier. Fixed number of points were collected from each of the workload times and fed to this svm. The svm used one to one comparison to output results. Thus for 3 classes , it did 3 
(3C2) classifications. This was followed by the 5-fold validation and average accuracy was noted over all seven subjects. 
The data was also filtered into multiple EEG bands but lower accuracies were obtained for each band as expected.


2.)	Monitoring Task:

The goal of the monitoring task was to find and analyse trends in the time-dependent entropy of the different channels of a subject over time and see how it is related to the development mental fatigue in the subject. As the channels by themselves did not have a significant trend, multiple channels were used with different weights to get a significant trend. 
This was done using a technique that give weights according to the trend in the channel. A linear fitting was done for each channel. The channels with highest modulus of this slope were selected. Each was given a weight equal to slope of that channel. These weights were first normalized by dividing by the sum of modulus of slopes of all the selected channels. This yielded a continuous rising trend for all the 30 subjects for both the trials. 
The same technique is currently being applied to different bands of the data to check whether better results can be obtained.

2.)	Monitoring Task
i.)	The results of monitoring task are stored in the following folder: “Folder name here”. On applying the above mentioned procedure, an increasing trend over time was observed for all the 30 subjects for each of their two trials. This indicated that time-dependent entropy can potentially be used as a biomarker for mental fatigue. Out of the four entropies in consideration, Renyi entropy gave the largest or most increasing trend followed by permutation tsallis and Shannon respectively.
ii.)	The same procedure was also applied to the mental workload data. Significant rise in entropies at points of change in workload were noted in several (23/60) trials. On decreasing the number of points considered in the rolling mean step, the number of trials that showed this sudden increases also increased. This shows that TDE can also be used to estimate mental workload in a given subject.
